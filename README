This script allows an entire MediaWiki wiki to be transformed into a mobile Website 
using only JQuery, JQuery Mobile & PHP (and a little HTML5 magic). With several
small changes, you could easily make it work as a mobilizer of just about any 
Website (even one not on your domain). 

Put these two scripts on your site root, and change the $jWikiHome variable 
to the domain of the wiki, the $jWikiHomePage variable to the home page of 
the mobile site, and the $mobileHome variable to the path to this script. 
Then put the following line in your .htaccess file in the same folder:

AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest
ExpiresByType text/cache-manifest "access plus 0 seconds"

That's it (we hope).

By default, caching on all pages is enabled via the cache.manifest file. 
This means that if the browser supports this feature of HTML5 (IE doesn't),
every page that users have visited online will still be completely
accessible when they are offline. This effectively turns your MediaWiki
into an online/offline mobile Web app. You'll see in the signup.php file
that this app was developed for Door43.org. You should check them out,
they're pretty cool (free and open discipleship resources for everybody).
